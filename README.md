"WITNESSFITNESS" is a school project for Android. The app is designed to keep track of your workouts from Running to your Gym sets. Using Java as the primary language, develop the app with the features available. Based on existing exercising apps, there are apps that keep track of the workouts done like running but the issue with comes when serious runners or does training IPPT. The app records the necessary information like pace, distance, heart rate but user's need to continuously look at the distance covered in the app while running. This might come as a distraction as it prevents the runner from focusing on the run. The app will alarm if time set for example, 11mins distance run, and user can then end their run then.
